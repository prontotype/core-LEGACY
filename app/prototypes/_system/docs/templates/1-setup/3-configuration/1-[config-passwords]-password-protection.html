# Password protecting your prototype

Prontotype makes it easy to add simple password protection to your prototype. Simply add the following to your [configuration file]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config') }}):

<pre class="brush: yaml">authenticate:
  password: example1234</pre>

The users will then have to enter the password **example1234** to access the prototype.

## IP Whitelisting

If you have set up a password you can additionally specify one or more whitelisted IP addresses. If anyone attempts accesses the prototype from any of these IPs then they will not need to enter the password.

To enable this add an `ip_whitelist` key with an array of IPs to your authentication config block as follows:

<pre class="brush: yaml">authenticate:
  password: example1234
  ip_whitelist: [127.0.0.1, 123.456.789.10]</pre>

In the example above requests from the localhost IP (**127.0.0.1**) and the IP **123.456.789.10** will be allowed access without a password.

## Overriding the login page template 

If want to create your own markup for the login page, it is possible to use a custom template of your choosing as a login page. The section on [overriding system templates]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('templating-overrides') }}) details how to do this.
