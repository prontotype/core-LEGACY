# Routing URLs to pages

Prontotype handles requests for pages by attempting to map a URL to a `.twig` file in the prototype's template directory, `/prototypes/{my-prototype-name}/templates`.

At it's simplest, it will map a URL to a template in much the same way that 'standard' URL to HTML page directory routing works.

**So for example**, given a URL such as `http://example.com/index.php/foo/bar`, Prontotype will look for the templates in the following locations, stopping when it finds one:

1. `/prototypes/{my-prototype-name}/templates/foo/bar.twig`
2. `/prototypes/{my-prototype-name}/templates/foo/bar/index.twig`

If neither file exists, Prontotype will show the default 404 page, which [can be customised]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('templating-overrides') }}) if required.
