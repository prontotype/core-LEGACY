# Routing URLs to pages

Prontotype handles requests for pages by attempting to map a URL to a `.twig` file in the prototype's template directory, `/prototypes/{my-prototype-name}/templates`.

At it's simplest, it will map a URL to a template in much the same way that 'standard' URL to HTML page directory routing works.

**So for example**, given a URL such as `http://example.com/index.php/foo/bar`, Prontotype will look for the templates in the following locations, stopping when it finds one:

1. `/prototypes/{my-prototype-name}/templates/foo/bar.twig`
2. `/prototypes/{my-prototype-name}/templates/foo/bar/index.twig`

If neither file exists, Prontotype will show the default 404 page, which [can be customised]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('templating-overrides') }}) if required. 

## 'Hidden' templates

Any directories or templates whose names start with an **underscore** (`_`) will be 'hidden' from the URL routing mechanism, and so will not accessible as pages. This is useful if you want to use one or more directories to contain template partials or layouts but don't want to risk them accidentally being exposed via a URL.

Any templates within these 'underscore-prefixed' directories can be used for extending or including as any other [Twig]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('templating-twig') }}) template would be.
