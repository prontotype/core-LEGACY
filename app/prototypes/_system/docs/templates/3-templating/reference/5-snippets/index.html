# Snippets template reference

All snippet methods are available under the `pt.snippets` template variable.

They are organised into logical groups of snippets - for details on the available methods for each snippet group please refer to the appropriate snippets documentation section:

<nav class="nav-inpage">
{{ pt.snippets.navigation.pageTree(pt.pages.getCurrent(), {includeParent : false}) }}
</nav>

{% endset %}
