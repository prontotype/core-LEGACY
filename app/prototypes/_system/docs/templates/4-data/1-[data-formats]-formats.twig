# Data formats

You can use data in YAML, JSON, XML, CSV and Markdown formats in your prototype. With the exception of Markdown, all of these are parsed into an array structure for [use in your templates]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('template-ref-data') }}). Markdown files are parsed through a Markdown parser and the contents are made available as a string.
