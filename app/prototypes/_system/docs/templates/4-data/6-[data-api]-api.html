# JSON Data API

There are times when you might want to access the data structures you've defined from your frontend JavaScript code. Prontotype makes this easy by giving you a URL for each data file that returns a JSON representation of that data. This allows you to make a Ajax request to that URL to access the data.

The URL for each data file looks like this:

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/<data_trigger>/<path_to_data></pre>

Where `<data_trigger>` is as defined [in the 'triggers' section of your config file]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}) (defaults to **_data**) and `<path_to_data>` is the path of the data file  that you wish to access.

So, using the default configuration, to get a JSON representation of the data in a YAML file `/data/posts/all.yml` you would make an Ajax request to `http://example.com/index.php/_data/posts/all.yml`.

<p class="note">If you want to <strong>disable this behaviour</strong> for security reasons, you can set the value of the <code>data</code> URL trigger in <a href="{{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}">your config file</a> to <code>null</code>.</p>

## Retrieving a subset of a file's data

You can also optionally supply a `path` URL parameter with a Twig-style dot notation data path (i.e. `path.to.item.in.array`) to access a subset of the contents of your data file. For example, given the following data file, `blog.yml`:

<pre class="brush: yaml">title: My Really good blog
posts:
  post1:
    title: A blog post
    body: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
  post2:
    title: Another blog post
    body: Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.</pre>

You would be able to access the JSON representation of `post1` via the following URL:

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/_data/blog.yml?path=posts.post1</pre>

Note that if the path is not valid for that document, Prontotype will return a 404 error. If this is likely to happen in your code it may be better to return the contents of the whole file and then traverse through it locally instead.
