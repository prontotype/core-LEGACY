# Data JSON API

There are times when you might want to access the data structures you've defined from your frontend JavaScript code. Prontotype makes this easy by giving you a URL for each data file that returns a JSON representation of that data. This allows you to make a Ajax request to that URL to access the data.

The URL for each data file looks like this:

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/<data_trigger>/<path_to_data></pre>

Where `<data_trigger>` is as defined [in the 'triggers' section of your config file]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}) (defaults to **_data**) and `<path_to_data>` is the path of the data file  that you wish to access.

So, using the default configuration, to get a JSON representation of the data in a YAML file `/data/posts/all.yml` you would make an Ajax request to `http://example.com/index.php/_data/posts/all.yml`.
