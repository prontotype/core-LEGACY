# Linking to files for download

Because your prototype directory is not publicly accessible it's not possible to directly link to files that you want to provide for download. Instead you'll need to place the files into a special directory called `/files` in the root of your prototype, and then link to them using Prontotype's download URL.

The URL for any file in your `/files` directory will look like this:

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/<files_trigger>/<path_to_file></pre>

Where `<files_trigger>` is as defined [in the 'triggers' section of your config file]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}) (defaults to **_files**) and `<path_to_file>` is the path of the file that you wish to access, relative to the prototype's `/files` directory.

So to link to a file located at `/files/animals/monkey.pdf` would look something like this (with [default URL trigger value]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}) and without enabling [clean URLs]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('pages-clean-urls') }})):

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/_files/animals/monkey.pdf</pre>

### Auto-generating links

Prontotype provides a [couple of methods]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('template-ref-assets') }}) for generating the links based on the path of your file (relative to the `/files` directory). A couple of examples of using these might look like this:

{% raw %}<pre class="brush: twig"><a href="{{ pt.assets.getFileUrl('animals/monkey.pdf') }}">Download now!</a></pre>{% endraw %}

There is also a [snippet method]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('tref-snippets-assets') }}) available for generating the entire file download link element:

{% raw %}<pre class="brush: twig">{{ pt.snippets.assets.fileLink('animals/monkey.pdf', 'Monkey map download') }} <!-- <a href="http://example.com/index.php/_files/animals/monkey.pdf">Monkey map download</a> --></pre>{% endraw %}

See the [assets snippets section]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('tref-snippets-assets') }}) for more information on using this snippet shortcut.
