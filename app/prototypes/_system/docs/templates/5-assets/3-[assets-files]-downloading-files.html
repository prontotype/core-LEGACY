# Linking to files for downloads

Because your prototype directory is not publicly accessible it's not possible to directly link to files that you want to provide for download. Instead you'll need to place the files into a special directory called `/files` in the root of your prototype, and then link to them using Prontotype's download URL.

The URL for any file in your `/files` directory will look like this:

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/<files_trigger>/<path_to_file></pre>

Where `<files_trigger>` is as defined [in the 'triggers' section of your config file]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}) (defaults to **_files**) and `<path_to_file>` is the path of the file that you wish to access, relative to the prototype's `/files` directory.

So to link to a file located at `/files/animals/monkey.gif` would look something like this (with [default URL trigger value]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}) and without enabling [clean URLs]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('pages-clean-urls') }})):

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/_files/animals/monkey.gif</pre>
