# Users and logins

To make it easier to prototype user-based interactions, Prontotype includes a system for mocking up users, accounts and logins. As a quick overview, the user/login system works as follows:

1. You define one or more users, with optional metadata, in a special data file called `users.yml`
2. Optionally update your prototype's [config file]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config') }}) to specify how you want your user's logins to be handled - Prontotype needs to know how to identify a user on login, and whether or not it should try to match an authentication parameter (like a password) or allow 'mocked up' authentication.
3. Create a login page in your prototype, with the form POSTing to the **login URL**.
4. In your pages, check for the value of the special `pt.user` variable. If a user is logged in
5. Optionally create a 'logout' link, pointing to the **logout URL**.


## The users.yml file

At the heart of the system is a data file called users.yml. If you don't have one of these in your prototype's `/data` directory, the system default one will be used, which looks like this:

{% raw %}<pre class="brush: yaml">default:
  name: Edward Xample
  username: example
  password: test
  email: ed@xample.com
  role: user</pre>{% endraw %}



{% endset %}
