# Snippets

Snippets give you a quick way to generate HTML and other content for your prototype. They are arranged together into groups which include **assets**, **forms**, **navigation** and **users** snippets. 

The [snippets template reference section]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('') }}) contains full details of all the methods available for each of the groups.
