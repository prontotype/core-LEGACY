# Installing Prontotype

To get up and running with Prontotype, follow the following steps:

## 1. Install Composer

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is a PHP dependency manager that Prontotype uses to make sure it's internals stay up-to-date. If you don't already have Composer running on your system then you'll need to visit the [Composer website](http://getcomposer.org/) for information on how to install it.

We'd recommend [installing it globally](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally) (and the installation command-line snippets below assume that to be the case) but it's entirely up to you!

## 2. Download Prontotype

You'll need to download the [latest version of Prontotype](https://github.com/prontotype/prontotype/archive/master.zip) from Github, unzip it and place the files somewhere accessible by your Apache server.

## 3. Install Prontotype's dependencies

Using the command-line (you can use Terminal.app if you are on a Mac), run Composer from the root of your Prontotype installation directory to install all of Prontotype's dependencies. The process might look something like this:

<pre class="brush: bash">$ cd /path/to/my/prontotype/installation
$ composer install</pre>

## 4. Make sure permissions are correctly set
The `/cache` directory in the root of your Prontotype installation will need the correct permissions to be writeable by PHP (probably 777 or 755 depending on your server configuration).

## 5. Point a domain at your Prontotype installation

Make sure Apache is set up to route requests from the domain of your choice into the <strong>top-level</strong> of your Prontotype installation, <strong>NOT</strong> the directory where your actual site's specific files are kept. See the [sites, domains and locations section]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('setup-domains') }}) for more information on locating your individual site's files and mapping domains to them.

## 6. Get prototyping! 

Once that is all done, visiting your domain at `http://mysite.com` (or whatever you are using!) should display the default Prontotype welcome page.
