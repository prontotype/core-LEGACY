# Prototypes and domains

Your prototypes can live wherever you like on your filesystem, and can be accessed by whatever domain you like - all you need to do is to tell Prontotype how to match up a your domain(s) with your prototype(s). Note too that a single install of Prontotype can also serve up multiple prototypes at multiple domains!

The `config/sites.yml` file tells Prontotype which domains match up to which prototype. The default contents of this file contains just a single prototype 'definition', and is as follows:

<pre class="brush: yaml">default:
  domain: '*'
  location: prototypes/default
  environment: live</pre>

This configuration will result in Prontotype serving up the default prototype (i.e. the one located in the `prototypes/default` directory within your Prontotype install) for *any* domain.

Of course, that is quite possibly not the behaviour you want, and so you have a number of options for configuring this behavior.

## Specifing a domain

The value of the `domain` key in the prototype definition tells Prontotype which domain that particular prototype definition block is intended for, and uses a simple wildcard pattern to match domains against. Below are some examples of patterns and the resulting domains that would be matched:

| Pattern | URL matches |
| ----- | ----- |
| foo.com | foo.com |
| foo.* | foo.com, foo.dev, foo.site etc |
| *.dev | foo.dev, bar.dev, test.dev etc |
| *.foo.com | bar.foo.com, hello.foo.com etc |
| \*.foo.\* | bar.foo.com, bar.foo.site, hello.foo.com, etc |
| * | foo.com, foo.dev, bar.site, hello.test.com etc |

## Specifing the prototype's location

The value of the `location` key should be the filesystem path to the prototype that you wish to be served up.

If it *doesn't* start with a forward slash (/), Prontotype will assume that the path is **relative** to the Prontotype installation itself, e.g. as used above for the 'default' prototype.

You can also store prototypes **outside** of the Prontotype install directory by providing a **full filesystem path** (beginning with a forward slash) as the value for the `location` key. So for example you could do the following:

<pre class="brush: yaml">myprototype:
  domain: '*'
  location: /full/path/to/myprototype
  environment: live</pre>
  
And the system will look for your prototype at `/full/path/to/myprototype`.

## Serving multiple prototypes from a single install

It is very easy to configure a single Prontotype install to serve up multiple prototypes for different domains, should you choose.

Using a single install as a prototype 'server' in this way is recommended if you have multiple prototypes, as in the future it means you only need to upgrade one set of code and all your prototypes will instantly benefit.

To serve up an additional prototype (e.g. one in a folder named **foo** within the `/prototypes` directory) at a different domain, simply amend the `sites.yml` file to add another prototype definition block, which could look like this:

<pre class="brush: yaml">foo_prototype:
  domain: 'foo.com'
  location: prototypes/foo
  environment: live

default:
  domain: '*'
  location: prototypes/default
  environment: live</pre>

This would serve up the **foo** prototype to all **foo.com** URLs, and the default prototype for all other URLs. Note that the reference name (e.g. 'foo_prototype') can be anything you like - it has no bearing on which prototype is served up (but *can be* used for reference purposes in certain functions, so it's worth picking a useful one).

<p class="note">Note that the <strong>more specific URL patterns</strong> should be specified first in the file - Prontotype will stop looking as soon as it finds a domain to match.</p>

You can add as many prototype configuration blocks to your `sites.yml` file as you like.

## Using environments {{ '{#' }}environments}

The `environment` key lets you specify an environment for each prototype match block. Using different environments is completely optional but lets you load different configuration files in for different matched domains if required (as discussed in the [configuration section]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config') }})).

So for example you could use the following `prontotypes.yml` file to serve up the same prototype but with a different environment value for the local **foo.dev** domain:

<pre class="brush: yaml">local:
  domain: 'foo.dev'
  location: prototypes/default
  environment: local

default:
  domain: 'foo.com'
  location: prototypes/default
  environment: live</pre>
 
This can be useful if you only want to [password-protect]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-passwords') }}) pages on your server but not on your local machine, for instance.
