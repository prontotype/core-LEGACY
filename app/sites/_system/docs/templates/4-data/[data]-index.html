# Working with data

Prontotype provides a simple but powerful set of tools for **including and working with data** in your sites.

It's possible to parse and use data in [YAML, JSON, XML, CSV and Markdown]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('data-formats') }}) formats. You can either use [local data files]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('data-local') }}) or retrieve data from [external sources]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('data-external') }}) (such as public API endpoints) via HTTP requests.

Prontotype also provides a simple way of [auto-generating 'fake' data]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('data-fake') }}) to help populate your site quickly and easily.

Lastly, all data files are also passed through the [Twig template parser]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('templating-twig') }}) so you can use loops, logic, variables and so on within them, if required. Locally stored data files can also include or extend other data files within your data directory, allowing for a great deal of flexibility. See the section on [using  data files as templates]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('data-twig') }}) for more information.

## Accessing data within your templates

There are a number of methods available to access your data from you templates. Full details of these are covered in the [data templating reference]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('template-ref-data') }}).
