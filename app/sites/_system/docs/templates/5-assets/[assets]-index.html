# Asset Handling

Prontotype provides you with a number of features to make working with assets (CSS, JS, images etc) in your sites straightforward, including on-the-fly Sass and LESS preprocessing and handy tools for generating placeholder images.

## Asset file locations

All your site's asset files should be stored within that site's `/assets` directory - for example at `/assets`. Within this directory you can organise you assets into subdirectories however you see fit.

## Linking to assets from your templates

By default Prontotype expects to dynamically serve up assets, allowing for preprocessing of files and other functionality. That means that rather than linking directly to an asset file, there is a special URL format that will serve up your files.

The URL for any asset in your site should therefore look like this:

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/<assets_trigger>/<path_to_asset></pre>

Where `<assets_trigger>` is as defined [in the 'triggers' section of your config file]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}) (defaults to **_assets**) and `<path_to_asset>` is the path of the asset file that you wish to access, relative to the site's `/assets` directory.

So to link to an image file located at `/assets/img/monkey.gif` would look something like this (with [default URL trigger value]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('config-triggers') }}) and without enabling [clean URLs]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('pages-clean-urls') }})):

<pre class="brush: xml">http://example.com/index.php/_assets/img/monkey.gif</pre>

### Auto-generating links

To make linking to your assets a bit easier, Prontotype provides a [couple of methods]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('template-ref-assets') }}) for generating the links based on the path of your asset file (relative to the `/assets` directory). A couple of examples of using these might look like this:

{% raw %}<pre class="brush: twig">{# Link to a CSS file #}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ pt.assets.getAssetUrl('css/page.css') }}" media="all" type="text/css">
{# Link to a image #}
<img src="{{ pt.assets.getAssetUrlPath('img/birds/blackbird.jpg') }}"></pre>{% endraw %}

Taking this a step further, there are also some helpful snippets for generating [link, script and image elements]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('tref-snippets-assets') }}) available to make linking to assets even easier. For example:

{% raw %}<pre class="brush: twig">{# Generate a link to a CSS file #}
{{ pt.snippets.assets.stylesheet('css/page.css') }} <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://example.com/index.php/_assets/css/page.css" media="all" type="text/css"> -->
{# Generate a link to a image #}
{{ pt.snippets.assets.image('img/birds/blackbird.jpg') }} <!-- <img src="http://example.com/index.php/_assets/img/birds/blackbird.jpg"> --></pre>{% endraw %}

See the [assets snippets section]({{ pt.pages.getUrlById('tref-snippets-assets') }}) for more information on using and configuring these snippet shortcuts.
