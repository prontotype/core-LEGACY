# Prontotype Overview

<p class="lead">Prontotype is a file-based system designed to help you easily build dynamic, data-driven HTML prototypes.</p>

<p>And whilst it's main aim is to make it super-easy to prototype everything from simple sites right up to complex apps, it's also a great tool for building regular sites too.</p>

## Prontotype features at a glance

* Quickly build linked, multi-page prototypes with clean URLs
* Define reusable chunks of HTML to make site-wide updates quick and easy
* Separate your layouts from your content using powerful template inheritance
* Mock-up everything from simple login behaviours to complex role-based authentication scenarios
* Use YAML, JSON, CSV or XML files to define data structures that will be accessible throughout your site
* Write CSS using Less or Sass (SCSS) and have it automatically compiled for use in your protoype
* Give your pages IDs so you can move them around easily without breaking links
* Use whatever frontend prototyping framework you like
* Quickly generate navigation, forms and more using in-built snippets
